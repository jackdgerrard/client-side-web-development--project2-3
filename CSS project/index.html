        Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very
        comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality. Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of
        graphic homoeroticism. A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of graphic homoeroticism. See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to
        unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory! So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not

        not a rude question. Acid? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its

        mean they're going to get them out? It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for
        ages. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed...
        Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Yes!
        If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them. Might want to play a bit hard to get. So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their
